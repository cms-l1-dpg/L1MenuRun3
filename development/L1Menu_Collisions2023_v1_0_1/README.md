**Comment:** 
New version of first 2023 menu for upt seeds testing and including update of upt logic expression.

<br/>

The following seeds have been added:
   - `L1_DoubleMu0_Upt6_IP_Min1_Upt4_IP_Min1` (bit 508)
   - `L1_DoubleMu0_Upt6_IP_Min1_Upt6` (bit 509)
   - `L1_DoubleMu0_Upt6_IP_Min1_Upt6_IP_Min1` (bit 510)


<br/>

**NOTE**: The default behavior of the script sets the prescales of seeds using NotBptx or Bptx to zero. This is due to problems emulating NotBptx in ZeroBias. If you wish to include the prescale information for these seeds, use the --includeBptx option.
