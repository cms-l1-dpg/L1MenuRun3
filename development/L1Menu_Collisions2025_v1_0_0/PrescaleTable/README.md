# Preliminary prescale table for L1Menu_Collisions2025_v1_0_0

**Comment:** 
In this preliminary version of the prescale table all the newly added physics seeds for 2025 have been enabled, except for `L1_SingleMu5_BMTF` (to be used only during lumi decay - its PS values to will be updated later).
In addition, we have:
   - disabled the seed `L1_DoubleEG11_er1p2_dR_Max0p6`
   - integrated the changes reported in [CMSLITDPG-1346](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSLITDPG-1346)

As usual for rate studies, the NotBptx seeds have been prescaled to 0.
