**Comment:** 
Alternative version of the 1st L1T menu for the 2025 pp data taking, with the old (v4, 2024) NN model for AXO seeds.
This menu has been created by using the last version of TME `0.17.2`, grammar `0.13.0` and `scales_2024_05_15`.

<br/>

The only change in this menu with respect to the previous menu version (`L1Menu_Collisions2025_v1_0_0`) is in the version of the NN model used by AXO seeds (bits 421-427), which is the `v4` - while in the menu `L1Menu_Collisions2025_v1_0_0` the `v5` model was used.
