# Preliminary prescale table for L1Menu_Collisions2025_v1_0_0

**Comment:** 
In this preliminary version of the prescale table all the newly added physics seeds for 2025 have been enabled, except for `L1_SingleMu5_BMTF` (to be used only during lumi decay - its PS values to will be updated later).
In addition, we have implemented all the requests from [CMSLITDPG-1346](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSLITDPG-1346) (except for [h], which would be needed to by revised by FOG according to the 2025 filling scheme anyway), only for the 2p0e34 column for the moment! 
Updates for other columns will be included in the next few days.
